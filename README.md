#  Cognifyz Internship Project: Investment Insights Dashboard
Visualizing real-world investment behavior using Power BI

## Executive Summary
This Power BI dashboard analyzes investment behavior across 40 individuals,to explore how people make investment decisions—what influences them, who they trust, and how their choices vary by age and gender. It turns into a story that’s easy to understand and act on.

## Business problem
Many people struggle to make confident investment decisions because they lack financial knowledge and rely on mixed advice. This project helps uncover who invests, why they do it, and where they get their information—so financial advisors can better support real-world needs.

## Methodology

- Used slicers so users can filter by gender, investment type, and duration
- Added buttons for smooth navigation and toggling views
- Designed charts that make patterns easy to spot—like who invests, why, and how often
- Built the dashboard in flexible pieces so it’s easy to update or reuse
- Focused on making insights simple, visual, and user-friendly
